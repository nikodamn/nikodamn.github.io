Welcome on my personal blog created for collecting my memories from trips around the World. This reports from trips are my diares and help me to keep every memories and pics in one place.

Who am I?

Amateur traveller.
I love to visit new places, get to know new culture, good, music and people. With my girlfriend we travelled through few interesting countries by hitchhike such as Albania, Netherland, Italy or Croatia. You can find few posts about on my blog or check out map with pinned places which I visited.

Programmer.
I'm studying Computer Science at Poznan University of Technology. I'm interested in Web Development (in wide spectrum of that subject). I started my interest at Frontend technologies, worked as QA and automated testing and ended on Backend-ish and Automation parts of that business. Now I'm working in Wikia Inc. where I'm gaining a lot of experience, working with amazing people on interesting projects. In near future I'd like to start writing posts about the most interesting parts of my job or programming in general. I'm planning to start describing few of my Automation, Testing and Chatops -related posts.

Football fan.
Also I'm passionate about football, especially Premier League and Manchester United. I've been following Man United since 1999 (Treble season!), so when I was 6 years old.

If you are interested in any of mentioned, check out my blog or reach me by e-mail.
